A  bronze PiXiu, belongs to my dad's super small antique collection. 
PiXiu is a creature from Chinese mythology who has the head of a dragon,body of a tiger and feet of a QiLin(yes,another mythology creature).
Legend says it brings wealth and good fortune.
So yea, that the first thing you'll see entering my house.
