a little place embedded in the wall to put stuff on display,
unlike other glass display, it has mirrors around the object.
basically when little me put my little head in between the mirror, 
I will see my face in the mirror and it would keep goes on and on and never ends.
I still don't understand why people would want to stand in a line for 3h to see the 
Infinity Mirrored Rooms by Yayoi Kusama. like i have it in my living room.
